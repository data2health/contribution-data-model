## Welcome

This repository contains modeling artifacts and documentation related to the **Contributor Attribution Model (CAM) Specification**.
Formal documentation is currently underdevelopment, and can be found at https://contributor-attribution-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 


## Overview
The **Contributor Attribution Model (CAM) Specification** is a standard developed within the [Center for Data to Health](https://github.com/data2health) (CD2H) [Architecting Attribution](https://github.com/data2health/architecting_attribution) project. It provides a **simple and tightly scoped specification** for representing information about contributions made to research-related artifacts - for example when, why, and how a curator contributed to a gene annotation record. 
| It is intended to be **used as a modular component of broader data models** that support data collection and curation systems, to facilitate reliable and consistent exchange of computable contribution metadata. 
  
The final CAM Specification will be comprised of the following components: 

1. A format-agnostic **Information Model** of the domain.
2. A **JSON-LD schema** formalization of the Information Model. ``coming soon`` 
3. A **TSV-based format and curation template**, based on the Information Model. ``coming soon``
4. **Ontologies** and **LD-Context Mappings** to support creation of RDF linked data. ``coming soon``
5.  A **code library and services** to support data creation and format interchange. ``coming soon``
6. An **Implementation Guide** to support creation of CAM-compliant data in different formats and contexts. ``coming soon``


## Status
At present only the foundational Informaton Model has been defined, along with the supporting Contribution Role Ontology (CRO). We expect an initial draft of all components to be complete and ready for a v0 release by the end of Spetember 2019.
