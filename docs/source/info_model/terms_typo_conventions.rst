Terms and Typographic Conventions
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
* In this documentation we use the term '**class**' to refer to core modeling types in the specification. In other specifications this concept may be referred to as a 'type', 'resource', or 'object'. When referred to as modeling constructs in the text, class names are Capitalized (e.g. ‘Person’, ‘Contribution’)
* We use the term '**attribute**' to refer to named characteristics or relationships of classes. In other specifications this concept may be referred to as a ' slot', 'element', 'field', or 'property'. When referred to as modeling constructs in the text, attribute names are italicized and camelCased (e.g. ‘startDate’, ‘qualifiedContribution’)
* We use the term '**data type**' to refer to more fundamental and general-purpose categories of data objects. These may include ‘simple’ data types (e.g. ‘string’, ‘integer’, ‘identifier’) that are represented as a single literal value, or ‘complex’ data types that are represented as objects with their own attributes (e.g.  ‘coding’). 
* We use the term '**instance**' or '**object**' to refer to instantiations of classes in the data. References to a specific instance in descriptions of data examples are written as ``inline literals`` in red Courier font.
* We use the term ‘**value set**’ to refer to named collections of codes that are bound to specific attributes. These are Capitalized in the text and include ‘Value Set’ in their name (e.g. ‘Contribution Role Value Set’)
* The capitalized keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", “RECOMMENDED”, and “REQUIRED”  in this document are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_.
