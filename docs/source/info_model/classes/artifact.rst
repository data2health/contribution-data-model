Artifact
!!!!!!!!

**Definition**: A physical or digital entity that is created, collected, modified, or cataloged by an agent. 

**Description and Use**: 
 
* Artifacts are the products of agent-driven activities, and represent things to which Contributions are made. 
* We are primarily concerned with material or informational artifacts used in generated by research-related activities.
* This may include natural specimens and man-made archaeological artifacts that are collected, modified, or cataloged for research purposes (e.g. a dinosaur fossil, an arctic ice core sample, prehistoric human tool fragments).
* Because the characteristics of Artifacts will vary dramatically across research activities and domains, the CAM model of Artifacts is minimal - specifying only generic metadata attributes and leaving domain-specific characteristics to implementations to define as :ref:`formal extensions<implementation-guide>` of the base Artifact class.

\* The :ref:`Artifact Type Value Set <artifact-type>` provided as part of this specification is RECOMMENDED but not REQUIRED. Implementations can choose to refine or extend this value set, or use their own.


**Examples**:
  
* This specification document describing the Contributor Attribution Model
* The Contribution Role Ontology
* This poster about the Architecting Attribution project
* This abstract submission about the Architecting Attribution project
* The HeLa cell line
* This protocol for culturing cell lines
* This dataset about tetrapod bony lesions
* This catalog entry for a centrifuge instrument
* The centrifuge itself
* The CIViC knowledgebase that holds curated information about the clinical significance of cancer mutations
* An individual curated record from CIViC about the BRAF V600E mutation.
* A dinosaur fossil collected and cataloged from a research site.
* Prehistoric tool fragments collected and cataloged form an archaeological site.
* An ice specimen collected from an arctic glacier.
* Database records cataloging and describing these ‘natural’ artifacts.


**Implementation Notes:** 
  
* **Artifact Identifiers** (*id* and *externalID*): 

    * Artifact identifiers can be captured in the id and externalID attributes. The id attribute MUST hold a single identifier that will be used to track/reference the artifact in the context of a given implementation.  This can be an internal de novo identifier, or one borrowed from an external resource or registry (e.g. a PMID for a publication, or ISBN for a book).
    * Additional external identifiers for the artifact MAY be captured using the externalID attribute. For example, the publication described in this Mouse Genome Informatics record has an internally-minted identifier (J:33382) that may be captured in the id slot, and an  external Pubmed identifier (8662814) that can be captured in the externalID slot.
    * The orthogonal issue of ensuring that all such identifiers are persistent, globally-unique, and machine resolvable is discussed here.


	
* **Typing of Artifacts** (*type* and *artifactType*)

    * The type attribute MUST be filled with the generic ‘Artifact’ type. To capture a more specific artifact type, implementations should use the artifactType attribute and bind it to a value set of terms that is suited for their domain and use case. We recommend using the Artifact Type Value Set provided as part of this specification, which can be used in whole or in part, and refined/extended as needed. But ad hoc value sets can be defined and used if desired.

* **Artifact Modification** (*dateModified*) 

    * The meaning of ‘modified’ may vary depending on artifact type or setting of use, and SHOULD be clarified by a given implementation.  
    * For material artifacts, this can include physical alterations or additions that do not alter the identity of the artifact. For informational artifacts, this can include updates to content or structure that do not result in a new version with a separate identity in the system of record.

* **Natural and Archaeological Artifacts** (*dateCreated* and *dateModified*)

    * Many natural or archaeological artifacts originate outside of a research setting, and are only collected and documented as specimens much later (e.g. a dinosaur tooth fossil, or prehistoric tool fragments).  Here, dateCreated SHOULD be used to record the date such specimens were taken, not the date they originally came into existence (which may have been thousands or millions of years ago). Similarly, dateModified SHOULD record when modifications were last made to the specimen in a research/academic context (e.g. samples extracted for analysis, etc.)
    * A related issue to consider is the fact that the CAM can describe contributions made to physical specimens and to catalog records describing such specimens.  We leave it to implementations to decide what type of artifact they want to track, and do this in a sensible and consistent way.  An exception is natural specimens that are observed and catalogued but not physically collected or modified in the process - where implementations SHOULD describe contributions to catalog record.
	
* **Relationships Between Artifacts** (*influencedBy*)

    * The notion of an ‘Influence’ between two artifacts broadly describes scenarios where one is directly or indirectly used in the creation of another.  It is based on the PROV notion of `influence <https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasInfluencedBy>`_ - but narrower in that it applies here only between two Artifacts. 
    * Influences can include derivation or incorporation of material or informational content - e.g. a cell line being derived from a tumor specimen, use of a jpg image into a blog post, or a format translation from a JSON dataset to an RDF version of the dataset. Influences can also cover an artifact providing a source of information used to generate an artifact with entirely separate content - e.g. a dataset on ice core CO2 levels used as evidence for an assertion about arctic climate change, a microscope/camera used to take images of tissue samples, or a knockout mouse strain used in a study to generate a dataset measuring blood glucose levels  which is used to support curation of a phenotype annotation on the deleted gene).
    * The CAM defines a single, generic influencedBy attribute to describe the Artifact-Artifact relationship in such scenarios. But implementations MAY define specializations of this attribute with more specific meaning - e.g. derivedFrom, revisionOf, informedBy, providesEvidenceFor, etc.
